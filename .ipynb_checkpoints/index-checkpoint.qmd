## Introduction

We seek to understand how feasible multimodal transport routes are in optimizing for minimal monetary costs and minimal social and environmental risk for CO2 Transportation.

## Methodology

Our main workflow is to develop and calculate the risk and cost constraints of each road/link segment of our network, and optimize based on the constraints to minimize cost & risk.

## Study Area Selection

Why Texas? According to Energy Information Administration (EIA), Texas State emits the most CO2 across all states, over 600 million tons, far more than any other states in the US. This is due to the state's numerous heavy industries including oil and gas refineries, dense population, and well-developed infrastructure and transportation system.

## Visual Overview of Transport Networks in Texas

Here, we can visualize the different transport modes considered in this study:

## Cost and Risk Analysis

In this section, we analyze the costs associated with each transport mode and evaluate the associated social and environmental risks.
