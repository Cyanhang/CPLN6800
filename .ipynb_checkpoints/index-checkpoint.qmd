## Introduction

We seek to understand how feasible multimodal transport routes are in optimizing for minimal monetary costs and minimal social and environmental risk for CO2 Transportation.

## Methodology

Our main workflow is to develop and calculate the risk and cost constraints of each road/link segment of our network, and optimize based on the constraints to minimize cost & risk.

## Study Area Selection

Why Texas? According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), Texas State emits the most CO2 across all states, over 600 million tons, far more than any other state in the US. This is due to the state's numerous heavy industries including oil and gas refineries, dense population, and well-developed infrastructure and transportation system.

## Visual Transport Modes Networks in Texas

Here, we can visualize the different transport modes considered in this study:

## Risk Analysis

Risk Model for Pipelines are shown below. 

![Risk Analysis Equations](images/riskequation.png){fig-align="center" fig-cap="Figure 8: Equations for calculating risk in transport modes."}

X1Pi is the average amount of fatalities per incident for accident type Pi 

X2Pi is the average amount of injuries per incident for accident type Pi 

X3Pi is the distance from the location on the pipeline with the highest probability of an incident to the closest hospital in meters

X4Pi is the average amount of CO2 released per incident for pipeline type Pi 

X5Pi is the total population in a radius of 5 km of the pipeline

X6Pi is the total number of kilometers a pipeline traverses vulnerable land
