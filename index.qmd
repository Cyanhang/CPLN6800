## Introduction

We seek to understand how feasible multimodal transport routes are in optimizing for minimal monetary costs and minimal social and environmental risk.

## Study Area Selection

Why Texas? According to ... Texas State emits far more than any other states in the US.

## Cost and Risk Analysis

In this section, we analyze the costs associated with each transport mode and evaluate the associated social and environmental risks.
